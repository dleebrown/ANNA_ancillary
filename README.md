# ANNA_ancillary

Scripts and files necessary to generate training sets for ANNA (see manual in repo). The included files other than the manual and Python scripts are what were used to generate Hydra-like spectra to train ANNA for my thesis. The atm folder contains the Kurucz/ATLAS atmospheric model grid I used.
